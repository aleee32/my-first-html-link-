    <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, commonly known as Neymar Jr. or simply Neymar, is a Brazilian professional
    footballer who plays as a forward for Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is widely considered
    one of the best players in the world, known for his pace, skill, and goal-scoring ability.

    Neymar began his professional career with Santos FC in Brazil, where he played from 2009 to 2013. During this
    time, he won several individual awards and helped Santos win the Copa do Brasil and the Campeonato Paulista.
    In 2013, Neymar transferred to Barcelona for a transfer fee of €86.2 million, which was a world-record at that
    time. He played for Barcelona for four seasons, during which he won several domestic and international titles,
    including two La Liga titles, three Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League. He also formed a
    formidable attacking partnership with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, known as the "MSN" trident.

    In 2017, Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record transfer fee of €222 million, becoming one
    of the most expensive football players in history. He has continued to perform at a high level with PSG, helping
    the team win several domestic titles and reaching the final of the UEFA Champions League in 2020.
    On the international level, Neymar has represented Brazil since 2010 and has played in several major
    tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup and the Copa America. He has scored over 70 goals for Brazil and has
    won the South American Footballer of the Year award three times.

    Off the field, Neymar is known for his flamboyant and flashy lifestyle, which has sometimes attracted criticism.
    He is also one of the most marketable athletes in the world, with several high-profile endorsement deals with
    brands such as Nike, McDonald's, and Red Bull.</p>
